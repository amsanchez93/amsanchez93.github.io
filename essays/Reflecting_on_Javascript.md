## Thoughts on Javascript 

Beginning my last semester as a Computer Engineering student, I believe my introduction to the Javascript language is long overdue. 
This however has helped me immenensly in appreciating Javascript as a language. Starting out, Javascript seems to be a fairly beginner friendly language.
It seems a lot friendlier when compared to other languages like C++ and much, much easier when compared to certain Assembly Languages. 
Although Javascript has some different rules that have taken me some time to get used to, the basics are similar to languages I've
been introduced to in the past. One of the major differences I've realized so far is that in Javascript there is no need to assign
types to variables whereas in C++ you must. I believe Javascript is a good language from a software engineering perspective, being a lot
'lighter', I believe, than C++, the language I'm most familiar with.

## Athletic Software Engineering. 

The introduction to 'athletic software engineering' is a great addition to my studies. As an ex-athlete, it is no surprise to me that the only way to improve oneself is to practice over and over again. This approach using 'athletic' software engineering is great. As someone who often takes to procrastination, it is nice to  be  'encouraged' to take the time out to complete certain exercises regularly, sometimes multiple times a week. In such a competitive field, it's important to make sure you're always working to make sure you stay on top.

## Practice 'WODs'

I believe the introduction of practice WODs or Workouts of the Day is a great way to keep students on their toes. WODs also introduces students to programming on demand which is often employed during job interviews. By regularly practicing WODs the students are able to practice working on their Javascript all the while helping with stress reduction. 

## Conclusion

I believe Dr. Johnson's teaching style is highly effective and a great way to motivate students to be their best.
