##Interest in Software Engineering

Starting my final semester as an undergraduate Computer Engineering Student, I do believe my introduction to a formal Software Engineering class is a bit overdue. This however does not mean I don't have experience in the subject. With past projects in other Computer Engineering classes, I've had to dabble in software engineering here and there. My interest in the subject, and my decision to finally take a Software Engineering class stems from a fascination with computer and programs from an early age. Marvelling at the complexity of computers and programs at a young age, it is great to finally be experiencing how all the 'magic' happens. 

Being enrolled in the Software Engineering class, I hope to expand my skills when it comes to programming. With a decent background coming from my many Computer Engineering classes, I don't expect this class to be too difficult, but I do understand the hard work and dedication that comes with programming. It will also be nice taking an Computer Science course, as I feel in the near future, as a computer engineer, I will be running into Computer Scientists often, as our fields share many similarities. 

The proximity of my graduation date, December 2016, also adds to the excitement that comes with taking this course. Knowing that this will be one of my last in my undergraduate career, I look forward to expanding my Software Engineering skills.
