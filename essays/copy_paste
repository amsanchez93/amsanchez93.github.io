## Personal feelings

After completing my first WOD, Island Snow, in which we recreated the [Island Snow]( http://islandsnow.com/) webstite, I found that using Semantic UI was as easy as ctrl+c and ctrl+v.
Once you have the basics down for one website all you have to do is copy and paste with a few modifications to make another. With this is mind, one begins to notice how similar many websites can be.
Take for instance, the [Nike](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/) website and the [Levis](http://www.levi.com/US/en_US/?camp=DRSearch:Yahoo_TM&K_AFFCODE=751_10379). 
They all are built pretty much the same, with a top menu bar followed by a banner of some sorts, and ending with another menu.
