## Thoughts on Javascript 

Begginning my last semester as a Computer Engineering student, I believe my introduction to the Javascript language is long overdue. 
This however has helped me immenensly in appreciating Javascript as a language. Starting out, Javascript seems to be a fairly beginner friendly language.
It seems a lot friendlier when compared to other languages like C++ and much, much easier when compared to certain Assembly Languages. 

## Societal Impact

Computer technologies have had plenty impact on the societies of the world. In our society, the biggest show of this is definitely social media. With the introduction of social media, it is now easy to dive deep into the lives of friends or even those you’ve never met before. This has a huge impact on our society, where lives were once private, now they are open to the world. Another computer technology that has impacted society would be one that allows social media, the Internet. The Internet has united the world, allowing instant communication between individuals near and far. This effects how societies interact with each other. The internet may make communication impersonal for those who were once close, but it allows communication between individuals who may have never had the opportunity. One last technology that has had an impact on societies and cultures in multiple countries is the cell phone. With the advancement of the cell phone, verbal communication is now instant. Someone can be reached at any time of the day. Before cell phones, individuals relied on leaving messages and having to wait for individuals to call back. Computer technologies have great societal impacts.

## Environmental Impact

Computer technologies have had a significant environmental impact and have the potential to do so in the future. Smart grid technology allows efficiency when it comes to distributing energy. This ensures that as little as possible energy is ‘wasted.’ This allows us to reduce the amount produced. Using computers to control traffic lights to make traveling more efficient can greatly reduce the amount of times that cars are on the road. This will reduce the amounts of toxic chemicals released into the atmosphere. On the same note, fully autonomous vehicles will eliminate the need for traffic lights at all. This would have the greatest impact on efficiency, lowering the amount of time the vehicle spends on the road, vastly reducing the amount of chemicals reduced into the atmosphere. 

## Contemporary Ethical Issues

With the advancement of computer technology, many contemporary ethical issues have arisen. One of the most popular ethical issues is surveillance. With modern computer technologies, it is very easy for those with the proper technologies to track and follow pretty much anyone that is ‘on the grid.’ This surveillance breaks plenty of laws, a big problem however, is finding out that it is happening. With computer technologies, especially with those who may be inexperienced, it may be impossible to tell if someone is surveilling you. Government agencies claim they do this for the safety of the people.  This is a huge ethical issue. Another ethical issue can arise from an example mentioned earlier. With the advancement of AI many jobs are becoming automated. This provides a clear ethical issue. Should we spare the jobs of humans if the job can be performed much better by an automated system or AI? Some would say that automating systems makes life easier for everyone in general. Reducing the amount of man hours needed to produce the same amount of goods. Others believe that individuals deserve the right to work. 

## Contemporary Technical Issues 

With any type of technology, technical issues will arise. One of the biggest technical issues that comes with computer technology is the rate at which such technology advances. New versions of cell phones are released every year. The question is what happens to the old models and all the waste that is created. This is a technical issue that is very important.

## Current Events/Issues and the Computer Engineering Problems

A computer engineering problem related to contemporary political issues may include a government’s ability to completely control their nation’s network. A recent example of this would be the Arab Spring where many countries shut down the internet in order to attempt to quell the uprisings occurring in their countries. Twitter was being used to coordinate and encourage others to take part in the uprising. 
	A computer engineering problem related to economic issues may include online banking. With the many vulnerabilities associated with networks, it may be easy for someone to make changes that aren’t necessarily allowed or legal. This provides an economic issue as it can hinder a company from operating normally.
