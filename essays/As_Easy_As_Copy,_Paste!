## Semantic UI

Semantic UI is a popular UI framework that provides a set of CSS classes that help simplify the development of a layout while providing
an attractive look-and-feel. Semantic UI provides huge advantages over raw HTML and CSS. Semantic UI provides a much easier solution to developing better looking websites with not much effort.  

## Personal feelings

After completing my first WOD, Island Snow, in which we recreated the [Island Snow]( http://islandsnow.com/) webstite, I found that using Semantic UI was as easy as ctrl+c, ctrl+v.
Once you have the basics down for one website all you have to do is copy and paste, with a few modifications to make another. With this is mind, one begins to notice how similar many websites are.
Take for instance, the [Nike](http://www.nike.com/us/en_us/) website and the [Levis](http://www.levi.com/US/en_US/?camp=DRSearch:Yahoo_TM&K_AFFCODE=751_10379) website. 
They share many similarities, with a top menu bar followed by a banner of some sorts, and then they end with another menu in the footer.

This, however, did not surprise me as Engineers of all sorts are always looking for an 'efficient' way to complete tasks.
