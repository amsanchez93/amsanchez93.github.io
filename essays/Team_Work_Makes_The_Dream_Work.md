## Introduction

Modern technology and computing has advanced at an outstanding rate in the past few decades. Behind this advance is the development of more reliable and robust programming. In order to produce quality work in this rapidly developing field, it is important that collaboration occurs. Collaboration, however, can prove to be quite difficult. With possibly hundreds of people contributing to possibly millions of lines of code, it seems that the possibility for "stepping on each others' toes" is all too real. 

## Personal Experience

As a computer engineering student, working on a team is nothing new to me. Early in my academic career, my partners and I relied on emailing each other our partially finished code with notes on what we've accomplished so far. This problem stemmed from our lack of knowledge on configuration management. As our academic careers have progressed, our knowledge on sharing has increased, helping us immensely. The greatest improvement to our sharing has been the introduction of Github.

## Github

There have been many attempts at producing software that could make collaboration an ease. Currently, the most popular software hosting system is Github. Github is a great tool for sharing code. Github provides users the opportunity to edit code without getting in each others' code. This provides users with peace and mind when editing code.
