## Introduction
This week, we were tasked with creating a web-application that allowed users to enter, and edit their personal information. Whether a user is entering billing information when purchasing something online, or signing up for a newsletter, this is a very common and often necessary feature on many different websites. We were tasked with implementing the most basic of these features over five different assignments. We did this using Meteor, a modern, open source, internet-based, client-server application architecture. 

Meteor has an immense amount of features that make creating web-applications much more efficient. However, with the vast amount of features comes a lot of learning how to use those features. To introduce us to some of these features, we were tasked with completing five different ‘WODs’ (6 in reality, the last WOD, however, was just cleaning up the code.) Because of Meteor’s steep learning curve, I found these WODs to be the most difficult we’ve come across. 

## Difficulties

I had an ‘okay’ time understanding the individual ‘pieces’ when developing with Meteor. How these individual pieces fit and work together, however, I am still working on. I have a much, much better understanding of Meteor and how it works compared to when I started, but I am nowhere near an expert, and I don’t expect to be soon. I spent a long time watching, pausing, ‘rewinding’ and rewatching Dr. Johnson’s video solutions. 

## Favorite Features

One of my favorite features of Meteor is how quickly you can be up and running. To set up and start developing only takes a few minutes, and once set up, Meteor takes little-to-no tinkering. Meteor’s ability to update almost immediately without the need to manually compile and update makes things much easier. The page I’ve just edited usually only takes about the time for me to switch tabs to update. This saves an immense amount of time when developing.

## Conclusion

I am very intrigued by Meteor, but I am still a bit intimidated by the complexity. I do expect to continue to use this amazing tool for many future projects to come. I thank Dr. Johnson for introducing me to another great developing tool.
