My team and I built, from scratch, a small autonomous robotic ‘mouse’ that can solve a randomly generated 16x16 cell maze (each cell is a 180 mm square with walls 50 mm high). My responsibilities included: design and fabrication of chassis and sensor mounts using SketchUp, design of PCB using EAGLE, and providing support in developing solving algorithm.
