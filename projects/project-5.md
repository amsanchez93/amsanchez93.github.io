[Application Demo (Video)](https://youtu.be/Y55aI77Opms)


I created a DBMS-backed web application that helps users track their workouts. Using multiple HTML pages and data persisted in a DBMS, this application can both write and read data to a relational DBMS. Users can create an account, enter their workouts, date of workout and current weight to track their progress across several days.
