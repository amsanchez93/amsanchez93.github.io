   The goal of this project was to use a Pulsed Light LIDAR-Lite V1 along with an RPLIDAR 360Â° Laser scanner mounted on a quadcopter to 3D map on a small scale. Using both devices, along with a Raspberry Pi 2 to handle processing, we will be able to map different 3-Dimensional small-scale environments at low cost.. This 3D mapping can possibly be expanded to allow for further applications in the future.
